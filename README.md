# CAD Models for Custom Robot Arm
The robot arm was built by me to learn more about ROS and 3D printing. The robot itself might not be all that spectacular, and the design is prone to oscillations. Nonetheless, it served as a good project for expanding my knowledge and taught me invaluable lessons. All the CAD models can be found on my GitHub. Sadly, all the related code is lost.
